#### a package for Physical Chemistry calculations of real gases laws

Real gases have nonideal behavior, considering that they are constrained and the molecules interact with each other. So, they are not able to adhere the ideal gas law, because compressibility effects, variable specific heat capacity and van der Waals forces are taken into account. In most cases, the ideal gases law approximation is accurate enough to describe some physical properties. But models with improved parameterization have to be used near to critical points, at very high pressures and to explain the Joule-Thomson effec.
